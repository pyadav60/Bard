...is a Discord bot that hosts music in call for Dungeons and Dragons sessions, deployed via Railway 24/7.

## Last Update:
- Railway deployment taken offline (its only free up to a certian extent)
- Need to adjust playback method (local downloads are not going to cut it)
- Basic functionality implemented via ffmpeg
- Downloads MP3 from provided youtube link and successfully joins the call to play it
